Shoe Resale Catalog

Many consumers currently purchase shoes from third-party sellers, including resellers and original manufacturers. However, finding trustworthy sellers can be challenging, and the process is time-consuming. Our solution is to create a user-friendly platform that allows buyers to input their specific preferences, such as brand, color, price range, and more. The platform will then present its findings, complete with ratings and reviews, reducing the risk of scams and streamlining the shoe-buying process. The other type of user on our site is a that of a sellter. Sellers will be able to easily upload their listing(s) to our shop and it will be added to our catalog following a brief verification period.
